always refer back to master.md and update it after you are done


i want to revamp the user flow such that on the root page, instead of clicking on create new project taking you to the the create project flow, it should take them to github oauth 

and on the upper right hand side, instead of new project it should render dynamically based on if the user is signed in or not, if they are not signed in, it should say dashboard and then navigate them to /dashboard, if they are not signed in, it will show Sign In which will take the user to the sign in with github flow, the same as 
what happens when you click on create new project in the center of the screen
