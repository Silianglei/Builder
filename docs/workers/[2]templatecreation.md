now let's go through the process of actually populating the backend with a template every time we create a repo 

i want the template to have a few core properties and then we will make it better over time

the front end should be built upon next js typescript, the backend should live within the next js app at /api and then the main thing is have the user authenticate into supabase, and then once we have access, we can create a project and link it into the project's .env and then link the mcp server into the template's claude settings
